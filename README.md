# Absorption-Emission_Spectra_Lab
 Some code I wrote for Pitt's CHEM 1430 AES lab. Some formatting may be off from what is required, so this is use at your own risk... That being said, this code provides a way to plot the emission line spectra as a whole, then also plot all of the individual peaks. From there it uses a fourier smoothing technique to filter out some noise, and then uses the smoothed data to find the different H<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> peaks/wavelengths for the respective emissions. I have not added functionality yet to automatically plot these values vs. the transition yet, but I may do so in the future.
 
 Furthermore, this also will fit theoretical Planck blackbody spectrums to experimentally found blackbody spectrums, and then provide the Planck temperature. You can also calculate the Wien temperature with this class.
